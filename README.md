# DNS

A [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) plugin for doing inline DNS lookups.

# Installation

## Package Control

Install [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). Gist will show up in the package list. This is the recommended installation method.

## Manual installation

Go to the "Packages" directory (`Preferences` / `Browse Packagesâ€¦`). Then clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/rcaldwel/dns


# Usage
    I have not tested this yet in Windows.  This plugin loads a couple of socket functions so it will need
    to have python installed locally.  Will test on windows soon.
